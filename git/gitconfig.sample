# Sample gitconfig
#
# I've pulled this out of version control because 1) I don't want my email
# and GitHub token on my public repo, and 2) I tried using the system-wide
# etc/gitconfig and it seems other clients don't always respect it (not to
# mention dealing with it in homebrew sucks). Don't let that stop you; you
# can symlink ~/.gitconfig to this file and go rock out with your git out!
#
# I'm not Zach, but I don't want to share my private info either. But I also
# want to make it easy to set up a new computer, so this is my .gitconfig minus
# secret things. I copy it to gitconfig.symlink (which is ignored by git), add
# my info, and then rake just does the right thing.
