# The Brewfile handles Homebrew-based app and library installs, but there may
# still be updates and installables in the Mac App Store. There's a nifty
# command line interface to it that we can use to just install everything, so
# yeah, let's do that.

# zpao: Yea, we aren't going to do this. I don't want to install everything.
# There's a homebrew extension (mas) that lets us install that way. It *should*
# work but I'm writing this from a set up machine already.

# sudo softwareupdate -i -a
